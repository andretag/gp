A homebrewed C++ library for Gaussian processes. {\bfseries gp} is developed by \href{http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dfk/}{\tt David Fridovich-\/\+Keil}, a second-\/year PhD student in the Berkeley \href{http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu}{\tt Hybrid Systems Lab} and the \href{http://bair.berkeley.edu}{\tt Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research (B\+A\+IR) Lab}.

\subsection*{Status}

{\bfseries gp} is still under active development. I hope to have a first release soon though, so stay tuned!

\subsection*{Structure}

All source code is located in {\ttfamily src/}; headers are in {\ttfamily include/}; unit tests are in {\ttfamily /test/}; and executables are in {\ttfamily exec/}. Compiled binaries will be placed in {\ttfamily bin/}.

\subsection*{Dependencies}

I may miss a few here, but here is a list of dependencies\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/}{\tt Eigen} (header-\/only linear algebra library)
\item Gflags (Google\textquotesingle{}s command-\/line flag manager)
\item Glog (Google\textquotesingle{}s logging tool)
\end{DoxyItemize}

All of these may be installed very easily. If you run into any trouble, though, I am more than happy to help you figure out what\textquotesingle{}s going on. Just post an \href{https://github.com/dfridovi/gp/issues}{\tt issue} on this repository and I will reply as soon as possible.

\subsection*{Usage}

You\textquotesingle{}ll need to begin by building the repository. From the top directory, type the following sequence of commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
mkdir bin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
\end{DoxyCode}


This should build all tests and executables. In order to run tests, you can run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./run\_tests
\end{DoxyCode}


from within the {\ttfamily build/} directory you just made. All the tests should pass, and none should take more than a second or so to run.

Executables are automatically placed within the {\ttfamily bin/} directory that you created. To run them, just type {\ttfamily ./(name-\/of-\/executable)}.

To the extent that it makes sense, all parameters are accessible from the command line via Gflags. For help with command line options, simply run the following command\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
./(name-of-executable) --help
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI documentation}

I\textquotesingle{}ve been using Doxygen to auto-\/generate web-\/based \href{https://dfridovi.github.io/gp/documentation/html/}{\tt documentation}. Although I do not follow the Doxygen guidelines for writing comments, auto-\/generation still seems to do a fairly reasonable job.
